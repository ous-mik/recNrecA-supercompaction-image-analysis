Removing background noise from brightfield cell images:
1. 	Duplicate image (stack) from original image. 
		Original image stack should not be multidimensional hyperstack.
		(Ctrl+Shift+D) 
2. 	Apply Median-filter to duplicated image(s). 
		(Process > Filters > Median > Radius = 10.0 pixels > OK)
3. 	Subtract filtered image(s) from original image(s). 
		(Process > Image Calculator... >
		Image1=Original, Operation=Subtract, Image2=Filtered Duplicate, 
		Check boxes "Create new window" and "32-bit (float) result" > OK)
4. 	Change image type to 16-bit for image (stack).
		(Image > Type > 16-bit)
5. 	Store resulting image (stack) for later.

Removing background noise from fluorescence images:
1. 	Duplicate image (stack) from original image. 
		Original image stack should not be multidimensional hyperstack.
		(Ctrl+Shift+D) 
2. 	Subtract background using rolling ball algorithm.
		(Process > Subtract background... > Radius = 5.0 pixels
		Check box "Sliding paraboloid" (no other) > OK)
3. 	Store resulting image (stack) for later.


----------------------
Combine corrected channels into image(s) for analyses:
1.	Merge the background corrected channels into one hyperstack. 
	Normally, use grey for brightfield cells, and colors for the fluorescence images.
		(Image > Color > Merge channels... >
		C2(green) = fluorescence channel, C4(gray) = cell channel, 
		Check boxes "Create composite", "Keep source images" and "Ignore source LUTs" > OK)
2. 	Arrange the order of the channels after your own preference. 
		(Image > Color > Arrange Channels...)


----------------------
Prepare image(s) for figures:
1. 	Modify brightness and contrast for channels in merged hyperstack. 
		(Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast...)
			Adjust the brightness/contrast of the channels to make sure you can see them as intended. 
			Use the channel slider to select the channel you will adjust the brightness/contrast for. 
2. 	For making figures, change image (stack) to RGB
		(Image > Type > RGB Color)
			The resulting image (stack) will have the brightness settings determined from the last step. 
			The image (stack) can be saved as TIFF or other formats and will appear in figures and 
			slides as intended. 
			Alternatively, the image (stack) can be annotated with sample name, treatment and time.
